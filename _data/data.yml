    - role: Graduate Research Assistant
      time: 2019 - Present
      company: ModLab, University of Pennsylvania
      details: |
        In the lab, I am pat of the ModLab research group whose main research interest is on modular robotics.
        Here, I am currently working on the ModQuad project. This project involves the design and manufacture of
        a novel modular structure in which a quadcopter sits in. The aim of the project is to develop distributed control schemes
        to attain desired swarm behaviour.
    - role: Summer Research Intern
      time: May 2018 - Aug 2018
      company: Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India
      details: |
        Developed an experimental setup consisting of autonomous Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) to test laws of
        guidance such as Pure Pursuit and Good Helmsman and tracking laws based on potential vector fields
        Developed controls using PID tuners for navigation of MAVs in indoor environment using data from IMU
        sensor and array of motion capture cameras. Implemented sensor fusion using Kalman filter to minimize
        noise and improve data reliability
        Developed the network for communication of data among MAVs, motion capture system and workstation
        using Robot Operating System (ROS) and Matlab
